# DIYBeauty
Android App built with Android Studio. This app is a demo version and is not available in Google Play, because it is only an exam project during my studies.
The idea of the app is to store beauty recipes. The main functionalities are: 
- browsing through a list of recipes on the home screen; 
- preview of each recipe on its own page with a function to add a recipe to a favorite list as well as sharing a recipe; 
= search screen for searching through the recipes' list;
